#####*Baltimore, MD* <dgelsin1@jhu.edu>

My name is Diego Rivera Gelsinger and I am a biologist with extensive training in:
◈ Microbiology ◈ Microbial ecology ◈ Astrobiology ◈ RNA biology ◈ High throughput sequencing ◈ Bioinformatics ◈

I received my Bachelors of Science in Microbiology with a minor in French at San Francisco State University. I carried out research for three years in the lab of Dr. José de la Torre, where I studied the physiology and metabolism of thermophilic ammonia oxidizing archaea from Yellowstone, USA and Yunan, China. 

I am currently wrapping up my PhD in the lab of Jocelyne DiRuggiero at the Johns Hopkins University. In my PhD I am researching the increased oxidative stress resistance of halophilic archaea from hyper arid climates (e.g. the Atacama Desert). My research has been carried out in two methodologies: 1. in a single isolated haloarchaea Haloferax volcanii, and 2. in a halophilic microbial community from Halite nodules in the Atacama Desert. 

### Small RNAs in *Haloferax volcanii*:

•	Developed mRNA-seq and small RNA-seq in order to identify that thousands of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are specifically expressed during oxidative stress, suggesting they play a role in the oxidative stress response. 

•	A subset of these sRNAs have anti-correlated differential expression profiles compared to their putative targets, all of which are transposons, suggesting their role in transposon silencing.

•	Developed ribosome profiling in archaea and identified many small RNAs have ribosome association.

•	Elucidated the mechanism of an oxidative stress specific intergenic sRNA, *SHOxi*, which plays a role in redox homestasis and survival.

### Small RNAs in Halite Microbial Communities:

•	Developed a pipeline for the discovery of small RNAs using metatranscriptomics (SnapT).

•	Collected samples over two years for metatranscriptomic sequencing.

•	Identified thousands of sRNAs expressed over both years.

•	Temporal and taxonomic specific expression of sRNAs.

•	Secondary structure determination and putative target identification of sRNAs using computantional tools.

### Postdoctorate Positions
I am currently applying for post doctorate positions to continue my career goal of being a primary investigator of a laboratory. My interests going forward in the next step of my career are: non-coding RNA biology, cancer biology, and the gut microbiome with specific interest in the gut-brain axis. If you have a postdoc position in one of these areas of research please take a look at my website/CV for my skill set and publications and email me.
